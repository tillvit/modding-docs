<h1>Understanding ActorMultiVertexes</h1>
<p>ActorMultiVertexes (AMVs) can be used to create complex shapes by providing a set of points.</p>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>
	AMVs work quite similar to a connect-the-dots puzzle. Each dot (called a vertex) has its own
	position on the screen, as well as a color and texture coordinates (We'll get to these two later).
	By positioning connecting these vertices in a certain way, we can create complex shapes.
</p>
<p>Here's a basic example of a triangle using an AMV:</p>

<h3>DrawModes</h3>
<p>
	Unlike a connect-the-dots puzzle, AMVs don't have to necessarily connect the dots with one long
	line. We can
